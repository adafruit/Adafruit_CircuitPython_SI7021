CircuitPython module for use with the SI7021 Temperature and Humidity Sensor.

Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_
* `Bus Device <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BusDevice>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle>`_.

Installing from PyPI
====================

On supported GNU/Linux systems like the Raspberry Pi, you can install the driver locally `from
PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/adafruit-circuitpython-si7021/>`_. To install for current user:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-si7021

To install system-wide (this may be required in some cases):

.. code-block:: shell

    sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-si7021

To install in a virtual environment in your current project:

.. code-block:: shell

    mkdir project-name && cd project-name
    python3 -m venv .env
    source .env/bin/activate
    pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-si7021

Usage Notes
===========

Of course, you must import the library to use it:

.. code:: python

    import adafruit_si7021

This driver takes an instantiated and active I2C object (from the ``busio`` or
the ``bitbangio`` library) as an argument to its constructor.  The way to create
an I2C object depends on the board you are using. For boards with labeled SCL
and SDA pins, you can:

.. code:: python

    from busio import I2C
    from board import SCL, SDA

    i2c = I2C(SCL, SDA)

Once you have created the I2C interface object, you can use it to instantiate
the sensor object:

.. code:: python

    sensor = adafruit_si7021.SI7021(i2c)


And then you can start measuring the temperature and humidity:

.. code:: python

    print(sensor.temperature)
    print(sensor.relative_humidity)
